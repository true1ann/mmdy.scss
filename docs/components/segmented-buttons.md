## MMDY.scss segmented-buttons
Using segmented buttons is a bit different from other components: you cant add anything else that `<button>`

```html
<div class="segmented-buttons">
  <button>Option 1</button>
  <button>Option 2</button>
  <button>Option 3</button>
</div>
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Inner buttons MUST NOT have any external styles applied to it.
